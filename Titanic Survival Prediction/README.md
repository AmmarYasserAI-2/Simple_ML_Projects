# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. The project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The project uses the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) which contains various features about passengers including:
- Passenger class
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Port of embarkation

## Project Structure

- `Titanic Survival.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and model building code
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with passenger information and survival data
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Model Performance

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy score of approximately 80% on the dataset, making it a reliable predictor of Titanic passenger survival based on the available features.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary data science libraries:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn

2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Titanic Survival.ipynb` to view the analysis and run the code.
