# 🧪 Simple ML Projects – Learning by Doing

Welcome to my chill space for small machine learning projects 👨‍💻  
This is where I build and upload **mini-projects** to practice **new algorithms** I learn — nothing crazy or massive, just pure hands-on learning vibes 🚀

> ✅ This repo is NOT for major projects — it's just my sandbox for learning and applying ML concepts as I go.  
> 📌 Some of my other (bigger) ML projects live in separate repos. This one is for the small, focused stuff.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Here

Whenever I learn a new algorithm, I try to apply it to a small real-world problem using real datasets (or toy ones).  
Each folder here is basically like a “learning checkpoint.”

Some concepts covered (Or Less idk, it depends on what time you see this repo):

- 📈 Simple Linear Regression
- 📊 Logistic Regression
- 🌸 Classification (e.g. Iris dataset)
- 💀 Binary Classification (e.g. Titanic dataset)
- 🏠 Regression Problems (e.g. House Price Prediction)
- 🧹 Basic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- ⚖️ Model Evaluation (accuracy, R², etc.)

More coming as I keep learning and growing 💪

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This repo is a part of my journey into the world of ML 🌍
I’ll keep adding more projects as I learn new stuff — it’s all about **getting your hands dirty and learning by doing** 🧠🛠️

If you’re a beginner too, let’s connect and grow together 💬
