# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Simple Linear Regression

This mini-project demonstrates how I used simple linear regression to predict house prices based on house size. It’s part of my “Simple ML Project” repo, where I practice new machine learning concepts with small, focused projects.

## 📊 What’s Inside

- A Jupyter Notebook (`house-price-prediction.ipynb`) with:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Data visualization
  - Building and training a linear regression model
  - Model evaluation (accuracy)
  - Code comments and markdown explanations

- A sample dataset (`house_prices.csv`)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to apply linear regression to a real-world regression problem
- Basic data cleaning and visualization
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Evaluating model performance

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run the cells step by step to see the workflow.
3. Check out the code comments and markdowns for explanations.

Feel free to use this as a reference or starting point for your own ML learning journey!
